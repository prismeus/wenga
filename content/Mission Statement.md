## What is your mission?

Wenga is dedicated to providing alternative resources for high school students in the KRG's English high school system.

There is a whole market built around senior-year students, who, more often than not, have to buy external guides and textbooks to ensure excellent marks during their year in high school. It has become almost impossible to attain such marks without the use of material outside of the official books, which are often not updated due to copyright issues with the companies that own the textbooks the KRG uses for education. This leads to many discrepancies in the educational process and effectively undermines official textbooks, forcing students to buy textbooks made by local teachers, which often charge exorbitantly.

This is simply one of many issues with KRG's high school system. Due to Wenga's nature as a bottom-up organization, we can't directly change the system, but our mission is to create and craft high-quality resources that supplement the local high school curriculum, especially senior year.

The cherry on top? The materials are **digital, open-source, and completely free**. You can feel free to print them, edit them, or use them however you wish. In light of the stress, difficulties, and forced majors already faced by students, ourselves included, we took it upon ourselves to at least ease the year.

Since we are primarily senior-year students ourselves, we face difficulties in allocating time for this project. If you would like to contribute to the project or join our team, please fill out [[The interest form |the interest form]], and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
